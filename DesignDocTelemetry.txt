Overall Design Goal:
  Design telemetry sending and receiving suite to get the most data possible
  
For Nikomedes Launch:
  Ground code to receive incoming data and log it to screen and file with timestamps
  In-Rocket Code to receive data from various sensors and pass this data to the antenna to be sent
  Launch is at start of November. Should be completely finished and tested before Halloween
  
For full launch:
  Ground code with full-featured GUI, ideally parses incoming data and does data analysis. Would ideally have GPS map tracking, graphs of
    altitude, pressure, orientation. Also telemetry info showing packet loss rate, data link rate. Everything recorded, either to
    monolithic log file or separated and organized on some db or other relational structure
    May include being activated by a series of button presses and switches from GPIO
  May or may not have scrath-coded telemetry on the rocket itself. Will probably be data sent from altimeters.
